Improved Blizzard UI
====================

Improved Blizzard UI is an attempt to improve the World of Warcraft interface by styling frames, implementing additional functionality and restructuring / hiding existing elements.

The AddOn is compatible with both Modern WoW and Classic WoW.

# Project Development Setup

Execute `./setup.sh` - This will pull in all dependencies and put them in the libs folder.

This will require you to have the following:

- SVN CMD (Eg, [SlikSVN](https://sliksvn.com/download/)) 
- ZIP Extension (If on Windows install [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/))
- Ability to open shell files (Eg, [Git BASH](https://gitforwindows.org/))
