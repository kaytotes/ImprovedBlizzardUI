ImprovedBlizzardUI
==================

Improved Blizzard UI is an attempt to improve the default Blizzard interface. This has been customized to how I personally like my UI set up. There is some very basic configuration in game but things like positioning and scale of items still needs modifying directly in the LUA.

Only 1920x1080 and 2560x1440 are supported / tested out of the box so some other resolutions may need tweaks.

Localized for enGB / enUS / deDE (ben2k1690) / ptBr (cyberdisarray) / ruRU (A few strings missing). See end of page for information if you would like to help localise.

# Project Setup

To get a working installation of ImprovedBlizzardUI you must first clone the repository to a directory of your choosing. From there `cd` into the `.release` directory.

Execute `./release.sh`

After a short while a configured and ready to go version of ImprovedBlizzardUI including a .zip file will be present in the `.release` directory.

# Addon Setup

* Install ImprovedBlizzardUI like any other addon.
* Ensure that the UI Scale option under **System** / **Advanced** is unchecked for correct scaling.
