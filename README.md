Improved Blizzard UI + (Battle for Azeroth Edition)
===================================================

This is a fork of the original [Improved Blizzard Ui]( https://github.com/kaytotes/ImprovedBlizzardUIPlus) by Kaytotes 
of which work has since ceased, and Improved Blizzard Ui Plus carries forth with improvements and continual bug fixes for future WoW Patch's

[Latest Releases](https://github.com/Misunderstood-Wookiee/ImprovedBlizzardUIPlus/releases/ "Download from GitHub Releases")

### Plus Edition? What gives.
As this suggests includes fixes for oversights & handles my personal gripes/desires. I do keep this updated as required via mergeing whenever Kytotes pushes fixes which do not directly conflict too maintain coherency between the original and this fork however due to Kaytots no longer providing support for BFA this version will likely be updated with better fixes, don't worry this version is still kept up-to date with the latest stability changes from Kytotos when they are made available.

The scope of this project/addon is staying true to the original where possible without major change to how the UI functions from the original, the original addon has been my primary UI for sometime now and I literaly refuse to play without it haha.

I also pull request any major fixes over to Kaytoes's original project though when or if he accepts those and pushes a new build to curse/twitch is out of my control.
